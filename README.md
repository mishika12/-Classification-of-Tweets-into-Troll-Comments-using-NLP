###Classification of Twitter Tweets as Troll Comments using NLP

 ### <ins> Introduction
Today, trolling has become a known evil and side-effect of social media where faceless individuals bully people online with hate/ toxic comments on their user profile. Thus, it has become essential for social media platforms to identify these comments as trolls and deploy a mechanism to remove them before they mentally disturb a user. 


 ### <ins> Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

 ### <ins> Methodology

The dataset uses a given training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist. The project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies the tweets as trolls/ not trolls using Natural Language Processing techniques.
